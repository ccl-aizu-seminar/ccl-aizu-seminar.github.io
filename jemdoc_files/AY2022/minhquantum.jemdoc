- *Title*: Quantum Entanglement: From Theory to Technology

- *Presenter*: VU Minh

- *Abstract*: Three physicists, Alain Aspect, John Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger, have won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for experiments that proved reality's profoundly strange quantum nature. Their experiments closed the debate between Bohr and Einstein over the interpretation of quantum theory began in 1927. They established the existence of a bizarre quantum phenomenon known as entanglement, where two widely separated particles appear to share information despite having no conceivable way of communicating. These delicate, pioneering experiments not only confirmed the quantum theory but also established the basis for a new field of science and technology.
